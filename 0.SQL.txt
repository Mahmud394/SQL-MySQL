SQL
What is Database?
Database is a collection of interrelated data.
A software application used to manage our DB is called DBMS (Database Management System)
Types of Databases:
	1.Relational ->MySQL,Oracle,SQLServer
		-Data stored in tables
	2.Non-relational (NoSQL) -> mongoDB
		-data not stored in tables
What is SQL?
SQL is Structured Query Language - used to store, manipulate and retrieve data from RDBMS.(It is not a database, it is a language used to interact with database)
It is used to perform CRUD operations :
	-Create
	-Read
	-Update
	-Delete
SQL Data Types
In SQL, data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column or variable.
	-VARCHAR-> String ->VARCHAR(50)
	-INT 
	-FLOAT
	-DOUBLE
	-BOOLEAN
	-DATE
	-TIME
	-YEAR
	-BIT->BIT(2)

Types of SQL Commands:

DDL (Data Definition Language) : create, alter, rename, truncate & drop

DML (Data Manipulation Language) : select, insert, update & delete

DCL (Data Control Language) : grant & revoke permission to users

DQL (Data Query Language) : select

TCL (Transaction Control Language) : start transaction, commit, rollback etc.

Primary Key->(a unique id)
There is only 1 PK & it should be NOT null.

Foreign Key->A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another table.
FKs can have duplicate & null values.

Constraints:
	-NOT NULL:columns cannot have a null value
	-UNIQUE:all values in column are different
	-PRIMARY KEY:makes a column unique & not null but used only for one
	-FOREIGN KEY: prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
	-DEFAULT: sets the default value of a column
	-CHECK: it can limit the values allowed in a column

Where Clause:
Arithmetic Operators : +(addition) , -(subtraction),*(multiplication), /(division), %(modulus)

Using Operators in WHERE

Comparison Operators : = (equal to), != (not equal to), > , >=, <, <=

Logical Operators : AND, OR , NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY

Bitwise Operators : & (Bitwise AND), | (Bitwise OR)

Aggregare functions:
Aggregare functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.
COUNT( )
MAX( )
MIN( )
SUM( )
AVG( )

General Order:
-SELECT column(s)
-FROM table_name
-WHERE condition
-GROUP BY column(s)
-HAVING condition
-ORDER BY column(s) ASC;

Joins in SQL:
Join is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
-Inner Join
-Left Join
-Right Join
-Full Join
